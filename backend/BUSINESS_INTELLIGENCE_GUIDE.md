## üéØ Sales Conversation Guide

### Opening Strategies by Segment

#### **Family Builder**
- "I can see that protecting your family's future is a top priority for you..."
- "Based on your assessment, we have comprehensive plans that fit your $X monthly budget..."
- "Your family protection goals align perfectly with our most popular coverage options..."

#### **Young Professional**
- "It's smart that you're thinking about protection early in your career..."
- "We have affordable options that grow with you as your income increases..."
- "Our digital-first approach makes managing your coverage super convenient..."

#### **High Net Worth**
- "Given your financial success, you deserve exclusive protection benefits..."
- "Our concierge service ensures you get personalized attention whenever you need it..."
- "We offer specialized coverage options not available through standard plans..."

### Objection Handling Templates

#### **"It's too expensive"**
- **Family Builder**: "I understand budget is crucial for families. We offer flexible payment plans, and our Complete Health Coverage starts at just $X per month - that's less than your daily coffee budget for comprehensive family protection."

- **Budget Conscious**: "Let's focus on essential coverage first. Our Basic Protection plan covers the most important risks for just $X monthly, and you can always upgrade as your situation improves."

#### **"I don't need insurance"**
- **Young Professional**: "That's exactly what I thought at your age! But consider this - one unexpected medical emergency could cost more than 10 years of premiums. Insurance isn't about if something will happen, it's about when."

- **Family Builder**: "I hear this often from responsible parents like yourself. The reality is, your family depends on you financially. A small monthly investment now protects their entire future."

#### **"I need to think about it"**
- **All Segments**: "Absolutely! This is an important decision. Based on your moderate risk profile, I'd recommend we schedule a follow-up within the week. In the meantime, I'll send you a personalized quote so you can review the exact details."

   - No exercise: +3 points

2. **Property Factors** (0-8 points)
